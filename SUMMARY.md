**Roundabout Aerial Images for Vehicle Detection** is a dataset for an object detection task. It is used in the vehicle detection domain. 

The dataset consists of 15474 images with 245763 labeled objects belonging to 5 different classes including *vehicle*, *cycle*, *truck*, and other: *bus* and *van*.

Images in the Roundabout Aerial Images dataset have bounding box annotations. There are 552 (4% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 8 splits in the dataset: *scene_1* (1996 images), *scene_2* (514 images), *scene_5* (1261 images), *scene_3* (1795 images), *scene_6* (5501 images), *scene_4* (1027 images), *scene_7* (2036 images), and *scene_8* (1344 images).
