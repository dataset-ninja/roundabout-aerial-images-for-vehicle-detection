**Roundabout Aerial Images for Vehicle Detection** is a dataset for an object detection task. It is used in the vehicle detection domain. 

The dataset consists of 15474 images with 245763 labeled objects belonging to 4 different classes including *car*, *cycle*, *truck*, and other: *bus*.

Images in the Roundabout Aerial Images dataset have bounding box annotations. There are 552 (4% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are no pre-defined <i>train/val/test</i> splits in the dataset. Additionally, the meta data about ***roundabout id*** (8 unique roundabouts), Drone's ***lattitude*** and ***longitude***, its ***height*** of exposure and ***height with zoom*** is provided. The dataset was released in 2022 by the <span style="font-weight: 600; color: grey; border-bottom: 1px dashed #d3d3d3;">Universidad Europea de Madrid</span>, <span style="font-weight: 600; color: grey; border-bottom: 1px dashed #d3d3d3;">SICE Canada Inc., Toronto</span>, and <span style="font-weight: 600; color: grey; border-bottom: 1px dashed #d3d3d3;">Universidad Francisco de Vitoria, Spain</span>.
