The authors of the **Roundabout Aerial Images for Vehicle Detection** dataset have compiled a comprehensive collection containing 985,260 instances across 61,896 color images. These images consist of both real captures (15,474) and augmented data (46,422), all in JPG format. These images were sourced from eight distinct roundabouts, each representing various traffic flow conditions. The presented dataset contains real captures only.

Given the meticulous nature of image annotation, the authors employed an effective methodology to streamline the process which minimizes manual annotation efforts. This involves annotating a limited number of images to train Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models capable of auto-annotating additional cases. Although these auto-annotations necessitate review, this approach reduces the need for extensive manual work. To further enhance dataset diversity without additional annotation, the authors applied data augmentation techniques, generating apparent new images.

The data collection process began by recording aerial videos of roundabouts and filtering out poor-quality segments. Captured using a DJI Mavic Mini 2 drone under varying conditions, these videos were shot during daylight from different heights. Heights between 100 and 120 meters were chosen to maintain the roundabout's visibility with entrances and exits discernible. This height range corresponded to a ground sampling distance (GSD) of 6.67 to 8 cm per image pixel.

Subsequent steps involved manual annotation of frames extracted from the videos using a Python script and annotation software. Annotations were created in PASCAL VOC XML format, generating an individual XML file for each image. To enhance dataset volume, data augmentation was applied using the OpenCV library and Python scripting. Synthetic images were generated by employing various flips, including horizontal, vertical, and combined orientations. This is a technique widely used to create seemingly new examples with the least amount of work.
